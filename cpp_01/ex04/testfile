Effects of Inheritance

Let's see how different components of class are affected in inheritance:

Static Members and Inheritance

In C++, static members belong to the class itself, not to any object.
This means static variables and methods are shared across all instances of the class.
When it comes to inheritance, static members from the base class are not inherited by the derived class in the traditional way.
However, they can still be accessed using the class name like className::staticMember.

Friend Function and Class in Inheritance

Friend functions and classes in inheritance provides functions or classes to access private and protected members of a class, providing flexibility and better control over class interactions.
In inheritance, friend function and classes are not inherited by the base class.
It means that the classes and functions declared as friends for the base class does not automatically become a friend for derived class.
